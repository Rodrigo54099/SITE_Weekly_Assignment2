## Week 2 Assignment: Student Store

Submitted by: **Rodrigo Martinez**

Deployed Application (optional): [Student Store Deployed Site](ADD_LINK_HERE)

### Application Features

#### CORE FEATURES

- [X] The API should contain an endpoint that serves an array of all products in the store
- [X] A Store model should handle all data management logic for the API and be the interface for read/write operations to the JSON file.
- [X] The frontend should include a landing page that displays the products available for purchase.
- [X] Each product should have an individual page that shows the details of the product.

#### STRETCH FEATURES

- [ ] Deploy your website with Heroku & Surge. 
- [ ] An endpoint should exist for creating orders and saving them to a JSON file. Each order should contain the email of the person placing the order, the items associated with the order, and the quantity of each item purchased.
- [ ] There should be a `Sidebar` component that appears on every page and has two states - `open` and `closed`. When the sidebar is opened, it should display a shopping cart of all the products the user currently has in their cart. It should also calculate and display the total amount in dollars for the checked-out items. When it's closed, the sidebar should be much thinner and not display its internal content.
- [ ] A checkout form should be available that allows the user to enter their email and send their order to the API.
- [ ] Create an endpoint for fetching all orders in the database, and an endpoint for serving an individual order based on its id.
- [ ] Create an endpoint that serves only a single product based on the product's id
- [ ] Build a page in the UI that displays the list of all past orders and lets the user click on any individual order to take them to a more detailed page of the transaction.
- [ ] Allow users to use an input to filter orders by the email of the person who placed the order.

### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes! I feel like we were presented with a lot of information this week, but the topics we went over in our labs and having the ability to go back ans rewatch the videos that helped us with the labs was really helped me complete the weekly assignment. At first, I felt overwhelmed by how much we had to complete for the weekly assignment because I was still new to react.js, express.js, and still getting used to API's. However, thanks to the help of my peers and instructors, I was able to solve a lot of my bugs and get a much better understanding of react and express than I did at the start of the week.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time to work on this weekly assignment, I would have definitely done my best to try and implement the shoping cart strech feature. I know some of my peers were currently working on that feature when we demoed our work in breakout rooms, and that is a feature that would most likely be a challenge for me, but would provide so much learning experience aside from what I have already accomplished. I would also probably play around with the CSS of my page a bit more and tired to give it a theme that may make it stand out!

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

My project demo went very well! I was able to show how I implemented the core features into my project and I was really amazed by what everyone in my breakout rooms had accomplished. I recall hearing someone say they used "material-ui" in their project and that gave their student store a very clean and fresh feeling! I will definitely look up material-ui and see if that is something I may be able to implement in my next weekly assignment.

### Shout out

I want to give a shout out to Shayan, Kordell, Brian, Paige, and any other instructor/peer that was able to help me along the way. I definitely had a lot of questions, and while I am proud I was able to answer some of them myself by googling and rewatching videos, I really couldn't have finished this weekly assignment without their help!
